		<h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
		
		<h2>Formating page Content</h2>
			<p>This is an exercise in how to use HTML elements to format basic page content</p>
		<h3>Adding headings</h3>
			<p>Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use 
			heading values ranging from top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several 
			competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you
			are using them to intelligent manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also 
			important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to 
			use headings is an important part of planning your site.
			
		<h3>Using paragraphs</h3>
			<p>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags. and one that you'll use often. 
			It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>
			
		<h3>Line Breaks</h3>
			<p>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a 
			new paragraph, to do that in HTML, you use the line break tag(&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, 
			meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.</p>
			<p>For example, you could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a a separate line,
			but still remained within the same paragraph.</p>

		<h3>Emphasize text</h3>
			<p>Often you will want to emphasize a particular phrase or word within your text. HTML give you several
			 different tags to do this with.</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt><b>The Bold Tag</b></dt>
				<dd>The bold tag (&lang;b&rang;) is mean to represent a span of text that you wish to set apart 
				stylistically from the rest of the text without inferring any type of special relevance or meaning. 
				It was removed from XHTML as being solely presentational, but added back to HTML5. as you would expect, 
				browsers typically bold this text.</dd>
				<dt><b>The Strong Tag</b></dt>
				<dd>By using the strong tag (&lang;strong&rang;) you are representing a string of text as having <strong>strong</strong> 
				importance. The text should be considered to be more important than the text surrounding it.it is typically
				 displayed as bold.</dd>
				<dt><b>The Italic Tag</b></dt>
				<dd>Like the bold tag, the italic tag (&lang;i&rang;) represents a string of text that is set apart 
				stylistically from the text around it. No particular meaning is attached to the text, rather it is rendered 
				in italics. Helpful for phrases, terms, or any text that is normally displayed in <i>italics</i>.</dd>
				<dt><b>The Emphasis Tag</b></dt>
				<dd>The emphasis tag (&lang;em&rang;), or "em" tag, denotes text that is emphasized more than the text around 
				it. Although this tag is usually rendered in italics, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather 
				it should be used for text that needs to emphasized for some reason.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p>Looking at these tags one may wonder why there are multiple tags for bolding and italicizing text. This is one of the 
			most confusing aspects of learning HTML.</p>
			<p>A way to look at it is this:  One set of tags is <em>presentational</em>, while the other 
			is <em>logical</em>. What that means is that presentational text doesn's convey explicit meaning, it merely serves to change the 
			styling of the text. Logical elements however do convey a specific meaning. Text that is either bold or italic are just 
			that, bold or italic. Text that is represented with a strong or "em" tag can represent multiple states. Using styles, 
			for example, you could change it so that the text is underlined or highlighted, By contrast, it wouldn't make much sense 
			to change the styling of a bold or italic element, since they are represented exactly as intended.</p>
		<h3>Display special characters</h3>
			<p>Certain characters are reserved for HTML, meaning that you aren't allowed to use them in regular content. Using a left angle 
			bracket like "&lang;" in your code can cause rendering issues in certain situations. Other characters are special characters or 
			symbols that might not be available through the keyboard, or are used by other languages. To represent those characters in normal 
			text, you can use what are known as named character entities.</p>
			<p>These are special codes that the browser or user agent will then replace with the requested character. The syntax for them is 
			relatively straightfoward. You start with an ampersand(&amp;) followed by the named entity that is then followed by a semicolon. 
			To display an ampersand, for example, you would type in &amp;amp;. This can be extremely helpful when displaying copyright (&copy;) and 
			trademark (&trade;) symbols, or writing mathematical formulas.</p>
